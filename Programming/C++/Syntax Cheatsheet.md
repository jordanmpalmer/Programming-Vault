## Basics

Basic syntax and functions from the C++ programming language.

### Boilerplate

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
cout << "Welcome To CodeWithHarry";
return 0;
}
```

### cout <<

It prints output on the screen used with the insertion operatorÂ 

```cpp
cout << "This is C++ Programming";
```

### cin >>

It takes input from the user used with the extraction operator

```cpp
cin >> variable_name;
```



## Data types

^de1dea

The data type is the type of data

### Character type

Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type

```cpp
char variable_name;
```



### Integer type

The most natural size of integer for the machine

```cpp
int variable_name;
```



### Float type

A single-precision floating-point value

```cpp
float variable_name;
```



### Double type

A double-precision floating-point value

```cpp
double variable_name;
```



### Void type

Represents the absence of the type

```cpp
void
```



### Boolean type

```cpp
bool
```



## Escape Sequences

It is a sequence of characters starting with a backslash, and it doesn't represent itself when used inside string literal.

### Alarm or Beep

It produces a beep sound

```cpp
cout<<"\a";
```



### Backspace

It adds a backspace

```cpp
cout<<"\b";
```



### Form feed

```cpp
cout<<"\f";
```



### Newline

Newline Character

```cpp
cout<<"\n";
```



### Carriage return

```cpp
cout<<"\r";
```



### Tab

It gives a tab space

```cpp
cout<<"\t";
```



### Backslash

It adds a backslash

```cpp
cout<<"\\";
```



### Single quote

It adds a single quotation mark

```cpp
cout<<"\'";
```



### Question mark

It adds a question mark

```cpp
cout<<"\?";
```



### Octal No.

It represents the value of an octal number

```cpp
cout<<"\nnn";
```



### Hexadecimal No.

It represents the value of a hexadecimal number

```cpp
cout<<"\xhh";
```



### Null

The null character is usually used to terminate a string

```cpp
cout<<"\0";
```



## Comments

A comment is a code that is not executed by the compiler, and the programmer uses it to keep track of the code.

### Single line comment

```cpp
// It's a single line comment
```



### Multi-line comment

```cpp
/* It's a 
multi-line
comment
*/
```



## Strings

It is a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes

### Declaring String

```cpp
// Include the string library
#include <string>

// String variable
string variable1 = "Hello World";
```



### append function

It is used to concatenate two strings

```cpp
string firstName = "Harry ";
string lastName = "Bhai";
string fullName = firstName.append(lastName);
cout << fullName;
```



### length function

It returns the length of the string

```cpp
string variable1 = "CodeWithHarry";
cout << "The length of the string is: " << variable1.length();
```



### Accessing and changing string characters

```cpp
string variable1 = "Hello World";
variable1[1] = 'i';
cout << variable1;
```



## Maths

C++ provides some built-in math functions that help the programmer to perform mathematical operations efficiently.

### max function

It returns the larger value among the two

```cpp
cout << max(25, 140);
```



### min function

It returns the smaller value among the two

```cpp
cout << min(55, 50);
```



### sqrt function

It returns the square root of a supplied number

```cpp
#include <cmath>

cout << sqrt(144);
```



### ceil function

It returns the value of x rounded up to its nearest integer

```cpp
double a=ceil(1.9);
```



### floor function

It returns the value of x rounded down to its nearest integer

```cpp
double a=floor(1.02);
```



### pow function

It returns the value of x to the power of y

```cpp
int a=pow(x, y);
```



## Decision Making Instructions

Conditional statements are used to perform operations based on some condition.

### If Statement

```cpp
if (condition) {
// This block of code will get executed, if the condition is True
}
```



### If-else Statement

```cpp
if (condition) {
// If condition is True then this block will get executed
} else {
// If condition is False then this block will get executed
}
```



### if else-if Statement

```cpp
if (condition) {
// Statements;
}
else if (condition){
// Statements;
}
else{
// Statements
}
```



### Ternary Operator

It is shorthand of an if-else statement.

```cpp
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
```



### Switch Case Statement

It allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values (cases).

```cpp
switch (expression) 
{
case constant-expression: 
statement1;
statement2;
break;
case constant-expression: 
statement;
break;
...
default: 
statement;
}
```



## Iterative Statements

Iterative statements facilitate programmers to execute any block of code lines repeatedly and can be controlled as per conditions added by the programmer.

### while Loop

It iterates the block of code as long as a specified condition is True

```cpp
while (/* condition */)
{
/* code block to be executed */
}
```



### do-while loop

It is an exit controlled loop. It is very similar to the while loop with one difference, i.e., the body of the do-while loop is executed at least once even if the condition is False

```cpp
do
{
/* code */
} while (/* condition */);
```



### for loop

It is used to iterate the statements or a part of the program several times. It is frequently used to traverse the data structures like the array and linked list.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
/* code */
}
```



### Break Statement

break keyword inside the loop is used to terminate the loop

```cpp
break;
```



### Continue Statement

continue keyword skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and returns to the starting point of the loop

```cpp
continue;
```



## References

Reference is an alias for an already existing variable. Once it is initialized to a variable, it cannot be changed to refer to another variable. So, it's a const pointer.

### Creating References

```cpp
string var1 = "Value1"; // var1 variable
string &var2 = var1; // reference to var1
```



## Pointers

Pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable

### Declaration

```cpp
datatype *var_name; 

var_name = &variable2;
```



## Functions & Recursion

Functions are used to divide an extensive program into smaller pieces. It can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.

### Function Definition

```cpp
return_type function_name(data_type parameter...){ 
//code to be executed 
}
```



### Function Call

```cpp
function_name(arguments);
```



### Recursion

Recursion is when a function calls a  of itself to work on a minor problem. And the function that calls itself is known as the Recursive function.

```cpp
void recurse()
{
... .. ...
recurse();
... .. ...
}
```



## Object-Oriented Programming

It is a programming approach that primarily focuses on using objects and classes. The objects can be any real-world entities.

### class

```cpp
class Class_name {
public: // Access specifier
// fields
// functions
// blocks
};
```



### object

```cpp
Class_name ObjectName;
```



### Constructors

It is a special method that is called automatically as soon as the object is created.

```cpp
class className { // The class
public: // Access specifier
className() { // Constructor
cout << "Code With Harry";
}
};

int main() {
className obj_name; 
return 0;
}
```



### Encapsulation

Data encapsulation is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and data abstraction is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.

```cpp
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class ExampleEncap{ 
private: 
/* Since we have marked these data members private, 
* any entity outside this class cannot access these 
* data members directly, they have to use getter and 
* setter functions. 
*/ 
int num; 
char ch; 
public: 
/* Getter functions to get the value of data members. 
* Since these functions are public, they can be accessed 
* outside the class, thus provide the access to data members 
* through them 
*/ 
int getNum() const { 
return num; 
} 
char getCh() const { 
return ch; 
} 
/* Setter functions, they are called for assigning the values 
* to the private data members. 
*/ 
void setNum(int num) { 
this->num = num; 
} 
void setCh(char ch) { 
this->ch = ch; 
} 
}; 
int main(){ 
ExampleEncap obj; 
obj.setNum(100); 
obj.setCh('A'); 
cout<<obj.getNum()<<endl; 
cout<<obj.getCh()<<endl; 
return 0; 
}
```



## File Handling

File handling refers to reading or writing data from files. C provides some functions that allow us to manipulate data in the files.

### Creating and writing to a text file

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
// Create and open a text file
ofstream MyFile("filename.txt");

// Write to the file
MyFile << "File Handling in C++";

// Close the file
MyFile.close();
}
```



### Reading the file

It allows us to read the file line by line

```cpp
getline()
```



### Opening a File

It opens a file in the C++ program

```cpp
void open(const char* file_name,ios::openmode mode);
```



### in

Opens the file to read(default for ifstream)

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::in)
```



### out

Opens the file to write(default for ofstream)

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::out)
```



### binary

Opens the file in binary mode

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::binary)
```



### app

Opens the file and appends all the outputs at the end

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::app)
```



### ate

Opens the file and moves the control to the end of the file

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::ate)
```



### trunc

Removes the data in the existing file

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::trunc)
```



### nocreate

Opens the file only if it already exists

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::nocreate)
```



### noreplace

Opens the file only if it does not already exist

```cpp
fs.open ("test.txt", std::fstream::noreplace)
```



### Closing a file

It closes the file

```cpp
myfile.close()
```



## Exception Handling

An exception is an unusual condition that results in an interruption in the flow of the program.

### try and catch block

A basic try-catch block in python. When the try block throws an error, the control goes to the except block

```cpp
try {
// code to try
throw exception; // If a problem arises, then throw an exception
}
catch () {
// Block of code to handle errors
}
```
