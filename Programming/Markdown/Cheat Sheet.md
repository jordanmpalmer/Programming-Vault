**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

*This text will be italic*

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

Use two equal signs to ==highlight text==.

Linking to other notes can be done very easily.  
Example: [[Original Sessions]]

If you want to show a custom name for the link you can add a pipe `|` after the NoteName and type the new name for the link.  
Example: [[Original Sessions|First Session Notes]]

You can also link to a sub-section of a note. Sections are created using # Headings.  
`Example: [[NoteName#HeadingName]]`
