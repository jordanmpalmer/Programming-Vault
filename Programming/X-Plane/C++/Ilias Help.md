Hi Jordan! All good my friend and hope the same for you! Having C++ background is great. The least is that will help you understand what's going on, when you look at some open source projects on Github. I personally, have no official programing training of any kind. I self-taught writing code in Lua, though the last ~6 months, I have jumped into c/c++ coding. So, I'm not the best person to give you advice on that subject, but I'll let you know my "discoveries"!

There is a repo doing the simplest thing, just draw something on the panel texture. The caveat is that utilizes library, libacfutils, and the drawing is done through cairo. https://github.com/amyinorbit/mtcr-demo

Based on this, I did some test myself, that you can find them here: https://github.com/airfightergr/avanti_plugin

Just some messy code to help me wrap my head around on what's going on.

The libacfutils repo is here: https://github.com/skiselkov/libacfutils, and the online documentation, here: https://skiselkov.github.io/libacfutils/index.html

You can search github for things like the term "xplm_Phase_Gauges", which is the one to draw stuff on the panel texture, and check the results: https://github.com/search?q=xplm_Phase_Gauges&type=code
